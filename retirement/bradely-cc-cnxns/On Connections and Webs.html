    <h1><b>On Connections and Webs</b></h1>
    <p>By Richard Bradley</p>
    <p>When I came west with my family in the summer of 1961 to take a teaching
    job at Colorado College, I thought I was doing something new, going to a
    school where few of our friends and none of our ancestors had ever trod.
    Imagine my surprise, then, when some 15 years later my stepmother in
    Berkeley, California, rummaging through old boxes in her attic, uncovered a
    diary my grandfather Cornelius Beach Bradley had written in which he
    described teaching here in the summer of 1892.&nbsp;<o:p>

    quick visit to the college archives conformed for me that he had indeed been
    here, and I also learned that 1892 was the first year the college had
    offered a summer session, calling it “The Colorado Summer School of
    Science, Philosophy, and the Arts” (note the regional implication --
    “Colorado” rather than “Colorado College” or “Colorado
    Springs”). The session lasted three weeks, a dozen or so faculty plus
    several assistants participated, mostly from Front Range schools but a few
    from as far away as both coasts. There were 175 students, mostly townsfolk.
    President William Slocum presided. A college bulletin written later boasted
    “ … a wide range of subjects was covered, and the greatest interest was
    manifest throughout, in all departments. The attractiveness of Colorado
    Springs as a place for recreation as well as for work was thoroughly
    demonstrated.” Doubtless true: Katharine Lee Bates succumbed to the
    attraction the following year and wrote “America the Beautiful.”</p>
    <p>But what had attracted Bradley that first year? His diary gives a hint:</p>
    <p>“ … I received an invitation to go there and accepted. The work was
    new to me, and therefore the more desirable, and it would bring me into
    acquaintance with eastern men.”</p>
    <p>More to the point, why had Bradley been offered the job at CC? Through
    what connections or contacts did Slocum even know about him? Again, the
    diary suggests an answer.</p>
    <p>“Arrived upon the theatre of action, I found the usual confusion of an
    opening term of school. I was quartered with Rev. C. E. Dickey (1200 N.
    cascade Ave.), whose home was made, by the kindness shown me by himself and
    his wife, one of the memorable abiding places of my many wanderings. With
    them I stayed three weeks and a little over.</p>
    <p>“The opening exercises were held in the Congregational Church on the
    evening of the 6th. Speeches were made by Pres. Slocum, the president of the
    Denver College, and by myself. My lectures began the next day in the course
    in Hist. &amp; Compar. Grammar, and also in Chaucer. The attendance was
    remarkable in being made up not of teachers, but very largely of notable
    women in town and folk not supposed to need further schooling. They did me
    the honor to attend in good numbers and they seemed greatly interested.
    There were 10 lectures in the one course and six on the other. Besides these
    I delivered an evening lecture in the Church on the novel, and read my Big
    Trees paper in the Chapel. I found a most warm reception everywhere in the
    community, and enjoyed the hospitality of a number of the good
    townspeople.”</p>
    <p>Reading the diary with its many references to church and clergy, I
    believe I understand why Slocum found him attractive: he was a man of the
    cloth as well as an educator. Colorado College at that time was a Christian
    college, founded and presided over by Congregational ministers. Bradley had
    been born and raised in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand), the son of missionary
    parents. After attending Oberlin College and Yale Divinity School, he
    returned to Siam, for three years of missionary service before settling in
    California to teach English. The United States was much less populous in
    those days. The number of people with his qualifications and experience
    could not have been large, and I suspect Slocum learned about him through
    the various ecclesiastical and educational societies they both must have
    belonged to.</p>
    <p>But there is another interesting connection to be made here that might
    have influenced Slocum, this one between the two institutions, UC and CC.
    The University of California, a land-grant institution chartered in 1868,
    arose on land ceded to it by the embryonic College of California, a would-be
    private coeducational liberal arts Christian college very much in the mold
    of the future Colorado College. One of the people out on the West Coast who
    had championed the creation of the College of California was none other than
    Edward Payson Tenney, the same person who in 1868 strove unsuccessfully to
    create another private coeducational Christian college just south of Denver
    modeled on the College of California blueprint, and the same person who in
    1876 became the first successful president of Colorado College, Slocum’s
    immediate predecessor. So Slocum had reason indeed to look favorably on the
    University of California -- where Bradley was a professor of English and
    Rhetoric -- when seeking new faculty.</p>
    <p>So many connections, such a tangled web! It brings to mind the oft-quoted
    statement by naturalist John Muir: “When we try to pick out something by
    itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.”</p>
    <p>And <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">that</i> suggests yet another
    strand in the web: Bradley, a good amateur naturalist in his own right (note
    the allusion in his diary to his paper “The Big Trees”) who spent all
    his spare time exploring the region, was a personal friend of Muir’s.
    When, in 1892 (again that date!), Muir gathered together 26 citizens from
    the San Francisco Bay area to form the Sierra Club, a wilderness advocacy
    group, Bradley was one of them, a charter member. They signed the articles
    of incorporation on June 4, just one month before Bradley caught the train
    to Colorado. Now fast-forward 85 years and we find Colorado College awarding
    an honorary degree to the Sierra Club’s first executive director, David
    Brower, widely considered John Muir’s heir apparent.</p>
    <p>Who was in Colorado Springs in 1892 that might have matched Bradley’s
    enthusiasm for hiking and climbing, and shown him some trails on his leisure
    time forays? Well, who indeed but mountain man Manley Ormes, one of the
    organizers of the local hiking group “The Saturday Knights,” a man who
    has a mountain peak named after him (as does Bradley). Ormes was not yet
    connected with the college -- that would come later -- but he was a
    Congregationalist, was not one to skip Sunday services (except once to climb
    Pikes Peak). Even if Bradley attended services on campus instead of in Ormes’
    church, which seems likely, he still must have met Ormes at some point. The
    town was no more than a village in those days. But the diary makes no
    mention of Ormes, and the archival file on Ormes in Tutt Library makes no
    mention of Bradley. Too bad. If they didn’t meet, they should have.&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p>Happily, that particular deficiency was rectified in subsequent
    generations. Manley’s son, Bob, a mountain man even greater than Manley,
    was teaching English at CC when we arrived in 1961, and we shared many a
    trail with him.&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p>I never really knew Cornelius Bradley. I met him briefly only once --
    when I was 6 and he was nearly 90 -- and I doubt we had a lot to talk about.
    But now that I have seen his diary, I would like to be able to swap stories
    with him. Quite obviously he enjoyed teaching here as much as I did.&nbsp;<o:p>
