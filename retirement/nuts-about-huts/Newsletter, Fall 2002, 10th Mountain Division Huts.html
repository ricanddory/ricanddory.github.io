              <p class="body_text">by Ric Bradley and Val Veirs</p>
              <p class="body_text">The Colorado College ski-hut trips have
                  been an annual rite of winter for
                nearly four decades. Beginning in 1963, and almost every year
                thereafter, a  
                small, congenial band of Colorado College folk, together with
                family and Colorado  
                Springs and Boulder friends, have parked their cars at a snowy
                trailhead and  
                skied many miles to a remote high mountain hut to spend a few
                days frolicking in  
                a winter wilderness wonderland. 
  This story begins in 1963, when Dorry and Ric Bradley joined Los Alamos  
  friends who had learned of two huts a few miles from Ashcroft. The U.S. Ski
                  Association was making them available to cross-country skiers
                  for about fifty
  cents 
  per person per night. The huts reputedly had stoves, cookware, and bunk 
  spaces. Skiers provided their own food, mess kits, personal effects, and 
  sleeping bags – and they also rustled their own firewood from the surrounding 
  forest. Dorry and Ric needed no arm-twisting to join the group. They had  
  made 
  several hut trips in California during graduate school days and knew exactly  
  how 
  much fun they could be. They signed on at once and soon were the mainstays 
  and energizing force for annual overnight hut trips in the Colorado high 
  country. Where else could they enjoy and display their flowing telemark 
  technique? 
  From this early start until 1990, the CC crew (now affectionately named  
“
  Uncle Ric’s Group”) visited the huts above Ashcroft almost every 
  year. We have always called our favorites - Tagert, Green-Wilson, Lindley,
  and 
  Markley - the “Fred Braun” huts. Fred had built some of these huts
  and after 
  the mid-1970’s, he maintained and administered them. We would call Fred
  a few 
  weeks before a trip and then stop at his cottage in Aspen where we would get  
  the 
  key, a weather report and some cautionary statements. Often we would also 
  get a couple of rolls of toilet paper or some kerosene for the lanterns or  
  some 
  other essential that Fred wanted us to deliver to the hut. Then we were off
  to 
  Ashcroft where we would stop and visit with Stuart Mace who, with his wife, 
  Isabel, were operating various businesses: sled dogs, cross-country ski  
  trails, and 
  a ski-in restaurant. Stuart was always good for some stories and he would  
  keep 
  our car keys and sell us that tube of blue wax that we had forgotten. 
  That venerable Colorado mountain man and author of “Guide to the  
  ColoradoMountains”, Bob Ormes, was a member of our party on several trips.
  Bob was a  
  terrible skier but a wonderful companion. Bob’s infectious laugh and
  non-stop 
  good humor would blunt the edge of cold and fatigue. Bob’s last trip
  was to 
  Tagert in 1980. This is a tough ski in for anyone, and especially for a person 
  in their 80’s, but Bob chuckled and laughed as he climbed over the blocky 
  remains of an avalanche that had flowed across the trail south of Ashcroft.  
  While we tried to link turns on the high, lovely rolling slopes in Pearl Basin  
  during the day, Bob maintained a steady effort chopping up a spruce tree that  
  had fallen near the hut. Each afternoon, when we skiers returned to the hut,  
  Bob had warmed it with his efforts. We were truly warmed by Bob Ormes on that  
  last of his trips into the high country in winter. 
  Night falls quickly in these high mountains in the winter. The huts above 
  Ashcroft had no solar-powered lighting in those days. We had a couple of 
  kerosene lanterns and a number of candles, and one kept one’s flashlight
  at  
  the 
  ready to peer into the soup pot to see how dinner was coming. But with the
   dark
  and the shadows came the easy intimacy of friends who have come to rely on
   each
  other. Experiences over the years deepened our trust and forged bonds that
   would never break.</p>
              <p class="body_text">Ski equipment has come full circle over these forty years of
                hutting. At the 
                start, everyone had all-wood touring skis. Trying to save a bit
                of money, we 
                often started out with three-pin bindings, but some of our frantic
                recoveries 
                from downhill near-disasters tended to rip the three-pin plates
                out of our 
                leather boots. After a few years, the more aggressive skiers
                in the group 
                replaced their three-pin bindings with cable bindings that serve
                well still 
                today. </p>
              <p class="body_text">Lightweight skinny skis pose a problem in backcountry skiing.
                They 
                give you wings, to be sure (Indeed Dorry and Ric, with Los Alamos
                friends,  
                once 
                skied the 25 miles from Crested Butte to Aspen via East Maroon
                Pass in a  
                single 
                day, something they never could have done with their old heavy
                all-purpose 
                equipment.), but skinny skis are also hard to maneuver, a drawback
                on a hut  
                trip 
                where much of the fun lies in trying to make squiggly paths down
                snowy slopes. 
                Dorry was perhaps the first person in Colorado to solve the problem
                by putting 
                cross-country bindings on lightweight downhill skis. Now, nearly
                30 years 
                later, the ski industry has finally caught up with her, and modern
                backcountry 
                telemark skis are practically indistinguishable from downhill
                skis.</p>
              <p class="body_text">Over time, attitudes change as well.
                  In 1976, Governor Dick Lamm and his
                wife, 
                Dottie, joined our group for a trip to the Lindley Hut. As we
                ascended the  
                long 
                shelf road we heard the tell-tale sound of snow machines climbing
                the road 
                behind us. All but the Governor stepped off the path, begrudging
                letting the 
                mechanized and smelly monsters command the trail. But Dick stayed
                the course, 
                making the machines bend to his will as they struggled to pass
                by in the soft 
                snow. Years later, in 1997, descending from a 10th Mountain hut
                named 
                Jackal, one of our members got going too fast and went off the
                trail, falling 
                and injuring his shoulder. Just as we got him out of the ditch
                one of those ‘
                infernal’ machines approached, stopped and the doctor onboard
                attended to our friend and then gave him a ride down to the car.
                So, we 
                have a curious love/hate relationship with these machines.</p>
              <p class="body_text">Typically on these hut trips, we spend
                  our days exploring the nearby terrain,
                practicing telemark turns, and, one year, building an igloo and
                a ski jump. In 
                the evenings we often sing, a warm fire crackling in the background.
                Somehow 
                skiing and singing just seem to go well together. Norwegian jumpers
                sing (or 
                used to), Swiss alpinists yodel, and our World War II ski troops
                were 
                famous for their songs. One song the ski troopers sang and we
                ski hutters  
                still 
                sing is “Zwa Brettl” (Bavarian for “Two Boards”).
                In 1938, Ric’s brother  
                David, 
                himself an occasional hutter, wrote an English translation that
                is still 
                the accepted version. Ignoring that the song might sound chauvinistic
                today,  
                we 
                believe it will resonate with anyone who, like us, has enjoyed
                a lifetime of 
                skiing and singing. The words to the final stanza are particularly
                poignant:</p>
              <p align="center" class="body_text"> <strong>Two Boards</strong></p>

                Letter from the director 
                - Forest Fires and Quite Use</p>
              <p class="body_text">It is fitting to address forest fires and travel management
                because they both  
                affect the future of the huts, although in opposite fashion.
                Forest fires  
                tend to have a more negative effect, whereas travel management
                should be,  
                thankfully, much more positive. </p>
              <p class="body_text">This past summer was difficult for many
                  people in our area because of the
                catastrophic forest fires and the resulting loss of homes, property
                and life. Our  
                empathy goes to those affected by the fires, and we hope that
                the passage of  
                time may return some of what was lost. We respect and admire
                all the  
                courageous and hardworking individuals who helped contain the
                forest fires, and  
                sincerely and fully appreciate all their efforts. We certainly
                appreciate  
                everyone’s compliance with fire bans this summer, and hope
                that next summer will be  
                more accommodating of traditional backcountry recreation. 
                 
                10th Mountain continues to participate in the public process
                of the Travel  
                Management Plan for the USFS White River National Forest. We
                are submitting  
                general and route-specific comments intended to enhance quiet-use
                areas around  
                the huts. But also we believe that non-motorized and motorized
                users have much  
                in common and can share some areas and routes and that the overall
                recreational  
                experience in certain areas will improve through separation of
                use based on  
                clear, logical boundaries. We think a well-balanced Plan has
                the potential to  
                improve the hut experience and we hope that the necessary resources
                will be  
                available to fully implement the Plan. We think it equally important
                that an  
                effective user-conflict monitoring program be included to allow
                land managers to  
                continue to make sensible, informed decisions. </p>
              <p class="body_text">Travel management planning is a public process, and as such
                your informed,  
                aware participation is important. Comments would be most valuable
                if strong  
                justifications and possible solutions are addressed. Please contact
                the USFS for

                Powder Day Greets Benedict Bike 150 Participants</p>
              <p class="body_text">By Scott Messina</p>
              <p class="body_text">Once again, the 10th Mountain Hut System
                  sponsored another adventurous bike
                trip from Aspen to Vail … well, almost.</p>
              <p class="body_text">After a brutally long, dry and hot summer,
                  the leaves began to change as our
                mid-September tour got underway and there was a hint of moisture
                in the air.  
                Much to our surprise, the fire ban inside the huts was lifted
                the day before we  
                started. This was good because the forecast called for cool nights,
                warm days  
                and “something in the weather” moving in. </p>
              <p class="body_text">Our group consisted of three trip facilitators
                  and seven participants, six
                from Los Alamos and one from Colorado Springs; ages ranged from
                38 to 64 years  
                old. After many emails back and forth between the participants,
                finalizing  
                details and answering questions, we met on a Saturday morning
                at 10th Mountain’s  
                office for a half-day “shakedown” ride to get to
                know everyone. The following  
                morning was clear and warm as we headed off to Margy’s
                Hut. Twenty-plus miles  
                later - and over 5000 feet of elevation gain - we arrived at
                Margy’s in time  
                to enjoy a cold beverage on the deck and bask in the warmth of
                a beautiful fall  
                day.</p>
              <p class="body_text">Monday started early and cold as we
                  headed toward Gates Hut, 28 miles away.
                The ride began with a 4400-foot descent, followed by 3,300 feet
                of climbing.  
                Day Two was not without some obligatory “endo’s”,
                but everyone escaped  
                unharmed. Listening to the National Weather Service report on
                the radio that  
                evening, we were slightly alarmed to hear the forecast for rain
                and possible snow.  
                It was hard to believe that it might rain, let alone snow, as
                we slept on the  
                outside deck during an unusually warm and crystal clear night.
                Besides, rain  
                would not be appreciated on our next day due to the mud and muck
                around the Gates Hut in Lime Creek (or “Slime” Creek,
                as the case may be). Unfortunately, 
                the forecast was accurate. At 3 a.m., the winds began to pick
                up, the sky  
                clouded over and the first sprinkles drove us inside. A few moments
                later, the  
                skies opened up and a downpour continued until morning. </p>
              <p class="body_text">We woke to new snow on nearby peaks and cloudy, misty skies.
                Optimistically,  
                we packed all of our warm gear and headed up the Burnt Mountain
                Road toward  
                Skinner Hut. We had a long day ahead - 24 miles and 5,400 feet
                of elevation  
                gain. Add an extra 10 pounds of mud to our tires, jammed into
                our brakes, and  
                stuck in our drive trains and it was tough going for the first
                three miles.  
                Fortunately, the weather cleared, the road turned to more stable
                rock and the day  
                began to brighten. We headed up to the North Fork Road toward
                Cunningham Pass.              </p>
              <p class="body_text">The best way to describe the last two miles of Cunningham is
                by imagining the  
                cobblestone streets of Holland tilted up on a 15% grade. We were
                all walking!  
  After Cunningham, we had a short downhill to the Hagerman Pass Road, then  
  panted up the final 20 minutes to the top of Hagerman. It was a bit cold, with  
  dark clouds looming to the west, but we had a great tailwind. From the top
  of  
  the pass, we rode the short downhill to the Skinner Hut, where warm water  
  awaited us on the stove. After a quick rest, a warm drink and a change into
  dry  
  clothes, we got all the mud off our bikes, lubed our chains and were ready
  for  
  the next day. </p>
              <p class="body_text">We knew there was a chance of snow that
                  night; reports on the local radio
                stations were calling for 2 - 4 inches. When I woke to make a
                bathroom run around  
                1 a.m., there were four inches of new snow outside – and
                still snowing HARD!  
                The remainder of the night was a bit sleepless, so I was up early.
                At first  
                light, I looked outside and laughed out loud, waking the folks
                sleeping by the  
                fireplace. “If I only had my skis to enjoy the 14-plus
                inches of new snow!” I  
                lamented.</p>
              <p class="body_text">Well, this was going to be an interesting
                  day. Riding from the Skinner to the
                10th Mountain Hut was supposed to be one of the easier days on
                our adventure,  
                but with 14” inches of snow?! We knew that lower down,
                by Turquoise Lake, we  
                would find much less snow, but going back up to the 10th would
                be a challenge.</p>
              <p class="body_text">At breakfast things slowed down and our usual pace was forgotten.
                It was  
                time for re-thinking our next few days. After checking out hut
                availability with  
                the office, trying to get more information from the local radio
                station (only  
                to hear that Vail Pass was closed due to heavy snow), and putting
                chains on  
                the support vehicle, the group gathered and everyone shared ideas. </p>
              <p class="body_text">“Stay and sit out the storm?” </p>
              <p class="body_text">“No, lets not waste a day sitting
                  when we can move on. How about we try for
                the 10th hut?” </p>
              <p class="body_text">“What about another hut?” </p>
              <p class="body_text">“Leadville for the night, and
              let the storm pass?” </p>
              <p class="body_text">“How about day rides in Aspen?”</p>
              <p class="body_text">“No, wait … Moab? Fruita?…” </p>
              <p class="body_text">Yes, that was it. We decided to pack
                  up the gear, head to the warmth of the
                desert and ride in shorts again. However, we still had to finish
                our adventure  
                and get to Leadville. We put on our warmest clothes and made
                first tracks  
                through 14 inches of snow. We rode through dense fog brightened
                by spectacular  
                yellow and orange aspen groves. Soon we were immersed in the
                warmth of  
                Leadville’s famous breakfast spot - the Golden Burro. Riders
                got a hot breakfast  
                while the support crew shuttled cars from Vail. We made our way
                to Fruita for two  
                more days of riding – without snow.</p>
              <p class="body_text">As with all adventures, it is great to have participants who
                are willing to  
                endure and be flexible. Thanks to Arvid, Hillard, Jim, Rodney,
                Larry, Kent and  
                Kevin, and especially thanks to my assistants, James and Debbie.</p>
              <p class="body_text">Don’t forget, next year’s “Benedict Bike 150” is
                scheduled for September  
                13-19th, 2003. Bring skis!</p>

                Avalanche Information Resources</p>
              <p> <span class="body_text">by Kestrel Hanson</span></p>
              <p class="body_text">It is important to consider Colorado’s
                  avalanche-prone snowpack when planning
                a hut trip in order to make wise and informed decisions about
                travel to and  
                around the huts. These decisions are crucial to a safe and successful
                trip.  
                The purpose of this article is to help you find appropriate resources
                to make  
                the best decisions.</p>
              <p class="body_text">A single snowflake does not cause an avalanche. Avalanches are
                the result of  
                what happens over time. We recommend that you start checking
                the avalanche  
                advisory reports (see phone numbers below) regularly before your
                trip to see  
                how conditions are evolving. You may also want to visit the Colorado
                Avalanche  
                Information Center (CAIC) website (www.geosurvey.state.co.us/avalanche)
                or  
                directly link from our site at www.huts.org for up-to-date avalanche
                information  
                for all of Colorado. </p>
              <p class="body_text">In addition, group leaders and participants
                  should take avalanche courses,
                which are offered by 10th Mountain, CAIC, and many others. Please
                visit  
                www.huts.org/education or contact your local educational institution
                for more  
                information. Also available at www.huts.org, under avalanche
                info, are listed  
                locations where avalanche debris has been found across suggested
                routes to 10th  
                Mountain Huts, Braun Huts, and the Friends’ Hut.</p>

                </strong><br>
                Have you ever wanted to learn more about the solar systems at
                  the huts, or  
                renewable energy (RE) in general? Thanks to a grant from the
                Aspen Skiing  
                Company Environment Foundation, 10th Mountain has partnered with
                solar education  
                organization, Earthsense, to author interpretive manuals about
                the hut solar  
                electric systems and other RE applications. Next time you are
                relaxing after a  
                long ski to a hut, enjoying the convenience of solar-powered
                lights, take a few  
                moments to read through the Solar Electric System Interpretive
                Manual. You’ll  
                find it in each hut’s interpretive library.</p>

                On Tuesday, August 20,
                2002 the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies took a group
                to the Benedict Huts for a presentation on the Warren Lakes reclamation
                project. For the past three summers ACES has played a lead role
                in the restoration of peat bog habitat at Warren Lakes, adjacent
                to the Fritz and Fabi Benedict Huts. This project partnered ACES
                with the U.S. Forest Service and incorporated field study work
                with several ACES Naturalist Field School courses, as well as
              community-based volunteer efforts.</p>

              <p class="body_text">by Hawk Greenway, Braun Hut Manager</p>
              <p class="body_text">It takes many different people to make this hut game work. Volunteers,
                staff,  
                dedicated backcountry skiers and donors all shape their respective
                roles and  
                help make our systems function. Often unsung, the role that hut
                board members  
                play can be easily overlooked. Not only do they tend to keep
                backcountry hut  
                programs focused, simple and out of trouble, they often come
                through with that  
                extra bit of dedication that really makes the difference. </p>
              <p class="body_text">Al Beyer is one such board member. A
                  licensed and practicing architect, Al is
                a dedicated hut user, which truly shows up in his architectural
                designs. He  
                simply knows how people use the hut spaces and can fashion structures
                that  
                really work well. You can sample his design sense at the Tenth’s
                Fritz and Fabi  
                Benedict Huts, where in 1997 he worked within strict Pitkin County
                guidelines to  
                create the pair of small and remarkable huts. You know you have
                enjoyed one  
                of Al’s hut designs when even the outhouse has a certain
                sense of class (and  
                view!).</p>
              <p class="body_text">Since Al joined the Board of Directors of
                the Braun Hut System in 1998, he
                has been the guiding light for the entire string of Braun Hut
                remodels. Working  
                within the existing footprints, and staying true to the very
                small (8 to 10  
                person) Braun hut concept, Al has designed each hut into a unique,
                sweet space.  
                Starting in 1999, with the Tagert and Green-Wilson Huts near
                Pearl Pass, the  
                remodels have received rave reviews. The Barnard Hut on Richmond
                Ridge followed  
                in 2000 and the Goodwin-Greene at Gold Hill was completed in
                2001. This year,  
                Al has been the driving force behind the Lindley Hut remodel.
                As the largest  
                hut (14 people) in the Braun System, the Lindley promises to
                become a favorite. 
                 
                So, if you are wondering what has happened in the backcountry
                hut game that  
                has made such a visible and lasting difference, it has been one
                dedicated  
                architect exercising his passion for huts that really work. I
                like to think that  
                Fred Braun is looking back at the changes in these huts with
                great approval and  
                appreciation. Thank you, Al.</p>

              <p align="center" class="subtitle_large"> 
                Backcountry Skiers Alliance</p>
              <p class="body_text">by Kim Hedberg, Executive Director</p>
              <p class="body_text">The Backcountry Skiers Alliance (BSA) continues to work to establish
                quiet  
                places to ski, snowshoe, and snowboard on public lands in the
                Southern Rocky  
                Mountains. This year, we are focusing on the White River National
                Forest Travel  
                Management Plan (TMP), Wolf Creek Pass, and Steamboat Springs.</p>
              <p class="body_text">The Forest Service has been taking comments on the TMP through
                October 31,  
                2002 and the BSA has outlined how to comment on this important
                document on our  
                website (www.backcountryalliance.org). At Wolf Creek Pass, a
                group of winter  
                users and agency personnel (Forest Service, Colorado Department
                of  
                Transportation, Colorado State Parks) has been meeting for the
                last year to determine the  
                best use of winter recreation on Wolf Creek Pass. This coming
                season, we will  
                be posting signs and collecting data to determine who uses the
                area in an  
                effort to determine how best to manage the area. In Steamboat,
                the BSA is still  
                working with the Winter Task Force on getting areas designated
                as non-motorized,  
                but due to lack of progress, other avenues are being investigated.
                Areas being  
                discussed for non-motorized designation include Rabbit Ears Pass,
                Buffalo  
                Pass, the Toutes (area just outside the ski area boundary), and
                the North Routt.</p>
              <p class="body_text">The BSA appealed the White River National Forest Plan late this
                summer. We  
                felt that the plan did not follow regulations governing forest
                plans due to a  
                lack of monitoring and inadequate disclosure of winter recreation
                conflicts and  
                explanation of how conflicts between users will be addressed.
                Specifically,  
                there are no motor vehicle closures for areas of the Forest as
                required by  
                regulation to resolve winter recreation conflicts. In addition,
                the management  
                prescriptions in the Vail Pass Area do not include boundaries
                currently in place.  
                We had anticipated that the plan would ensure that the work done
                by the Vail  
                Pass Task Force was reflected in the plan, but it was not. Finally,
                we are  
                concerned that ski area expansions allowed in the plan adversely
                affect quality  
                backcountry terrain. We hope to negotiate some changes with the
                Forest Service.</p>
              <p class="body_text">The BSA, along with our Steamboat Chapter - the Friends of the
                Routt  
                Backcountry - have also appealed the Blue Sky West Permit in
                the Buffalo Pass area  
                outside of Steamboat Springs. This permit allows the snowcat
                operators (Blue Sky  
                West) to build a road next to the small area reserved for non-motorized  
                recreation. Even the snowmobilers recognized that this would
                cause snowmobiles to  
                enter this non-motorized area, which they did last year. We hope
                the Forest  
                Service will take our appeal seriously so that some areas of
                solitude can be  
                retained in the area. </p>

                consider joining. We are almost completely supported by membership
                and if we do not  
                have adequate funding, we will be unable to work on issues that
                are important  
                to you! Increased membership strengthens our voice. Thanks for
                your support!</p>
